# Weighted Total Domination Problem
The Weighted Total Domination Problem (WTDP) belongs to the family of dominating set problems. Given an edge- and vertex- weighted graph, the WTDP consists in selecting a total dominating set 𝐷 such that the sum of vertices and edges weights of the subgraph induced by 𝐷 plus, for each vertex not in 𝐷, the minimum weight of its edge to a vertex in 𝐷 is minimized. A total dominating set 𝐷 is a subset of the graph’s vertices such that every vertex, including those in 𝐷, is at least adjacent to one vertex in 𝐷. This problem arises in many real-life applications closely related to covering and independent set problems, however it remains computationally challenging due to its np-hardness. This work presents a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) procedure to tackle the WTDP, and investigates the advantages and disadvantages of a multi-start strategy within VNS methodology. In addition, we develop a Biased Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (Biased GRASP) that keeps adding elements once a feasible solution is found in order to produce high-quality initial solutions. We perform extensive numerical analysis to look into the influences of the algorithmic components and to disclose the contribution of the elements and strategies of our method. Finally, the empirical analysis shows that our proposal outperforms the state-of-art results, and the statistical analysis confirms the superiority of our proposal to find the best total dominating sets.
# Datasets
The testbed of instances is divided into two different subsets. On the one hand, there are 180 instances directly derived from the state of the art for the WTDP, with the number of nodes ranging from 20 to 125. This set of instances is divided into two subsets in the literature, named as MA (45 instances) and NEW (135 instances). On the other hand, we propose a new set of 135 more challenging instances, named CSM, with size from 200 to 500 nodes to analyze the limits of the compared algorithms.
